I am pleased to recommend Bryan Kanu as a valuable addition to the Study Abroad Program and I believe he would be a valuable recipient of a scholarship for this experience. I had the pleasure of working with Bryan when he successfully completed my trigonometry course at the UC- Blue Ash campus. Throughout the term Bryan displayed a great maturity, creativity and enthusiasm for learning. He is an excellent and driven student who seeks out new experiences and strives to do everything within his means to gain the most from every activity he participates in.

In the classroom, Bryan is an inquisitive and diligent leader; asking questions beyond the correct answer. He wants to fully understand the material beyond the temporary need to complete an assignment. Bryan is also a student willing to share his questions, knowledge and understanding with his peers. He is never afraid to speak up in class as well as in study groups in the Math Lab. 
I believe the opportunity to study abroad will further strengthen Bryan's inquisitiveness and add more breadth to his knowledge, understanding, and compassion for his own and other's learning. 

These reasons allow me to recommend Bryan without reservation for the Study Abroad Program and scholarship. I expect he will excel in your program and continue on to an excellent career. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
